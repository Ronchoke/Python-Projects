# Python-Projects
Here are projects that I did in my learning process of python:
- Top100: running this module will parse for the current top 100 songs as published on the Billboard website, finds the lyrics for each song, and plots two graphs:  
          1. Most Verbal Artist - analyzing the lyrics, show the top 10 artist that use most unique words.  
          2. Most Used Words - analyzing the lyrics, show the top 100 most common words used in all songs.
